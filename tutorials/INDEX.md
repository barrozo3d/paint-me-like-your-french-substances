- **Summary:** Flagship 3h19m full-helmet texturing demo (priority creator, maximum-depth extraction) covering block-out-first material planning, base materials for metal/plastic/paint/leather/rubber/fabric/a fake-PBR "coating"/glass, anchor-point-driven multi-effect masking as the video's throughline (paint chips, leather cracks, decal grime all built from one paintable control mask referenced by multiple downstream layers), model detail added purely in texture (normal stamps + generator-driven extrusion picked up later by curvature/cavity), decals/stickers/projected text, a unifying top-of-stack "Overlays" composite pass (cavity/edge/dirt/color-variation), emissive, and a PBR-Validate-then-export-to-Unreal finish. Extremely dense — see the tutorial file's Structured Notes for exhaustive per-material step lists.

### How to TEXTURE in SUBSTANCE PAINTER | Creature TEXTURING
- **Source:** YouTube
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lwep-faQVI0
- **Author:** Jared Chavez
- **App:** Substance 3D Painter
- **Version:** not specified (pre-12.1-era UI, approximate)
- **Tags:** `masks` `layers` `paint-layer` `fill-layer` `procedural` `alpha` `basecolor` `roughness` `color-management` `game-engine` `unreal-export` `advanced`
- **Summary:** Process breakdown of texturing an original xenomorph-style creature (translucent-skin reference from deep-sea fish, no fixed concept to follow): sub-dermal color blocking, a documented mid-project "everything looks wrong" struggle resolved by exporting to Unreal Engine to diagnose color under real lighting, a granite-material happy accident reused as skin discoloration, a hand-painted symmetrical head pattern, and a parallel Unreal subsurface-scattering shader pass.

### TEXTURING METAL from Scratch in SUBSTANCE PAINTER
- **Source:** YouTube
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X5gKTjMGes

### How to TEXTURE like a PRO with ANCHOR POINTS | Substance Painter Tutorial
- **Source:** YouTube
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2W67e5MQuk
- **Author:** Jared Chavez
- **App:** Substance 3D Painter

### How to make SKIN TEXTURES in Substance Painter
- **Source:** YouTube
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0DhvFML7oM
- **Author:** J Hill
- **App:** Substance 3D Painter
- **Version:** not stated on screen; baking-dialog UI matches pre-8.3.0 (likely predates the companion "TEXTURE EVERYTHING" video by several versions), tentative
- **Tags:** `layers` `fill-layer` `paint-layer` `masks` `generator` `curvature` `ambient-occlusion` `thickness` `tri-planar` `procedural` `blend-mode` `pbr` `basecolor` `roughness` `specular-glossiness` `normal-map` `height` `alpha` `color-management` `texture-set` `export` `export-preset` `channel-packing` `intermediate`
- **Summary:** Priority-creator, maximum-depth extraction (companion/prequel to "How to TEXTURE EVERYTHING"). Hand-painted, reference-driven PBR skin texturing: RBX imaging and cross-polarized photography as BaseColor reference, anatomy-mirrored Sub-Dermis/Dermis folder organization, the video's core repeated pattern of layered multi-scale procedural noise masks (Screen to add, Multiply to subtract) topped with a hand-paint edit pass, thickness-map- and curvature-driven lip discoloration, a custom Specular Level channel + matching export preset, Photoshop-style non-destructive adjustment layers (empty Pass-Through paint layer + HSL/Levels/Sharpen filters), and an iterate-export-render loop validated in Marmoset Toolbag rather than Painter's own viewport.

### Creating Trim Sheet UVs for Substance 3D Painter | Adobe Substance 3D
- **Source:** YouTube
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp2ZpGIaumA
- **Author:** Adobe Substance 3D
- **App:** Substance 3D Painter (destination only — UV prep shown in 3ds Max)
- **Version:** not specified — no Painter UI shown, DCC-side UV work only
- **Tags:** `uv` `texel-density` `game-engine` `unreal-export` `intermediate`
- **Summary:** DCC-side (3ds Max) UV-unwrap prep for a shared trim-sheet texture: grid-snapping tileable UV shells, deliberately-stretched end caps, mapping long structural sections onto one repeated tileable strip, plus deform-mesh-to-trim, thin "construction line" details, decal planes, and a grunge overlay. No Substance Painter UI appears — the trim sheet itself is the artifact that later gets painted/applied in Painter. Cross-linked with the "Create Trim Sheets in Substance 3D Painter" Part 1/2 pair.

- **Summary:** Full 3-UV-Tile suit texturing pipeline (jacket pinstripes, tie, dress shirt/vest, plastic accessories) built from smart materials, hand-built stripe fill layers, curvature/generator color variation, and an anchor-point-driven weave detail layer; the throughline technique is fixing pattern-direction mismatches across UV islands with a UV-set-to-UV-set fill projection source referencing a second guide UV channel authored in the DCC app. Exports to an Unreal-style PBR template and finishes with a full Marmoset Toolbag 5 lighting/render pass.
