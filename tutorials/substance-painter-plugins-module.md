**Transcript:** substance_painter_plugins module  This module allows to manage the Substance 3D Painter Plugins: listing existing Plugins, loading or unloading a given Plugin, etc. A Substance 3D Painter Plugin is a standard Python module, placed in a path added to substance_painter_plugins.path , which can use the Substance 3D Painter Python API to do certain tasks. Example import importlib import substance_painter_plugins # Get the list of available Plugin names: all_plugins_names = substance_painter_plugins . plugin_module_names () for name in all_plugins_names : print ( name ) # Load the "hello world" Plugin: plugin = importlib . import_module ( "hello_plugin" ) # Start the Plugin if it wasn't already: if not substance_painter_plugins . is_plugin_started ( plugin ): substance_painter_plugins . start_plugin ( plugin ) substance_painter_plugins. path = []  A list of strings that specifies the search path for plugins. Initialized from SUBSTANCE_PAINTER_PLUGINS_PATH environment variable, Substance 3D Painter installation directory and Substance 3D Painter user resources directory. You need to call explicitly substance_painter_plugins.update_sys_path after updating this variable. A plugins directory is expected to contain three subdirectories, automatically added to sys.path : plugins : Modules that are loaded as optional components. startup : Modules that are always loaded at application startup. modules : Utility modules, shared across plugins. Modules in plugins/ and startup/ directories are expected to have a start_plugin() and a close_plugin() methods, respectively called after loading the module and before unloading it. Modules added in plugins/ directory take precedence over modules added in startup/ directory. Type : list substance_painter_plugins. plugins = {}  Currently started plugins. Type : dict substance_painter_plugins. start_plugin ( module )  Start the given Substance 3D Painter plugin. Parameters : module – A Python module that is expected to have a start_plugin method. substance_painter_plugins. close_plugin ( module , gc_collect = True )  Close the given Substance 3D Painter plugin. Parameters : module – A Python module that is expected to have a close_plugin method. gc_collect – Run a full garbage collection if set to True. substance_painter_plugins. is_plugin_started ( module )  Check if the given plugin is currently started. Parameters : module – A Python module. Returns : True if the given module is currently started, False otherwise. substance_painter_plugins. reload_plugin ( module )  Reload a plugin and start it. Read importlib.reload(module) documentation for possible caveats. See start_plugin() and close_plugin() for details about starting and closing a plugin. If the plugin has a reload_plugin method, it will be executed after closing and before restarting the plugin. The purpose of reload_plugin method is to reload manually all sub-modules the plugin depends on (in case the plugin is a Python package for example). Parameters : module – A Python module. Returns : The reloaded plugin module. See also start_plugin() , close_plugin() , importlib.reload(module) documentation . substance_painter_plugins. startup_module_names ( )  List the names of the available startup modules. Returns : The names of all the available startup modules. Return type : list[str] substance_painter_plugins. plugin_module_names ( )  List the names of the available plugins modules. Returns : The names of all the available plugins modules. Return type : list[str] substance_painter_plugins. load_startup_modules ( )  Load all startup modules. substance_painter_plugins. close_all_plugins ( )  Close all started plugins. substance_painter_plugins. update_sys_path ( )  Update sys.path according to substance_painter_plugins.path and SUBSTANCE_PAINTER_PLUGINS_PATH environment variable.
