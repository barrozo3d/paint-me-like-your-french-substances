# paint-me-like-your-french-substances — Setup Guide

This file serves two purposes:
- **For you (human):** step-by-step instructions to get the skill running on a new machine
- **For Claude:** checklist to follow when the user says "set up this skill", "check if installed", or "new machine setup"

---

## For Claude: Setup Sync Rule

**Every structural change to the skill must update these three files in the same commit.**

A structural change is anything that would affect how someone installs or runs this skill on a fresh machine:
- New pip dependency added to `ingest.py` or any script → update `requirements.txt` + `setup.ps1` (pip install step) + `SETUP.md` (Step 3 or Troubleshooting)
- New system dependency (new tool required) → update `setup.ps1` + `SETUP.md`
- New environment variable required → update `setup.ps1` + `SETUP.md` (add a step + Troubleshooting entry)
- New CLI flag added to `ingest.py` or `select_frames.py` → update `SETUP.md` (Ingest Pipeline Reference section)
- Directory or file renamed/added → update `SETUP.md` (Skill Structure section)
- Git repo URL changed → update `SETUP.md` (Step 2) + `setup.ps1` (clone URL comment)

**Commit + push format for structural changes:**
```
git add ingest.py requirements.txt setup.ps1 SETUP.md
git commit -m "feat/fix: <what changed> + sync setup pack"
git push
```

Never leave setup files out of sync with the actual skill state. The push is mandatory — the GitHub copy is what other machines clone, so a local-only commit is not enough.

---

## For Claude: New Machine Setup Protocol

When the user says any of: "set this up", "new machine", "is this installed", "check dependencies", "help me configure this skill" — follow this checklist in order. Run each check as a shell command, report results, and fix what's missing.

```
CHECKLIST:
1. python --version                          → need 3.10+
2. ffmpeg -version                           → need any version on PATH
3. python -c "import yt_dlp"                 → need installed
4. python -c "import whisper"                → need installed
5. python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"  → True = GPU ready
6. Test-Path ~\.claude\skills\paint-me-like-your-french-substances\SKILL.md   → need True
```

For anything missing:
- **ffmpeg missing** → `winget install ffmpeg`
- **pip packages missing** → `pip install yt-dlp openai-whisper`
- **torch CPU-only** → `pip install torch --force-reinstall --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`
- **Skill not found** → `git clone https://github.com/barrozo3d/paint-me-like-your-french-substances.git ~\.claude\skills\paint-me-like-your-french-substances`

After fixing, re-run the checklist and confirm all green before proceeding.

This checklist covers the **ingest/consultant pipeline only**. The optional live Substance Painter connection (see "Substance Painter MCP Connection" below) is a separate setup that requires Substance Painter itself installed and is never assumed to be ready — only walk through it if the user explicitly asks for Mode 4 (live connection).

---

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10 / macOS 12 / Ubuntu 20.04 | Windows 11 |
| Python | 3.10 | 3.11–3.12 |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB+ |
| GPU | — (CPU works) | NVIDIA RTX (any) for fast Whisper |
| Disk | 5 GB free | 10 GB (Whisper models cache here) |
| Internet | Required for ingest | — |
| Substance 3D Painter | Not required for consulting | Only needed for Mode 4 (live connection) or to run generated Python |

---

## Step 1 — Install Claude Code

If Claude Code isn't installed yet:
- Download from: https://claude.ai/download
- Or install the VS Code extension: search "Claude" in Extensions

---

## Step 2 — Clone the Skill

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/barrozo3d/paint-me-like-your-french-substances.git "$HOME\.claude\skills\paint-me-like-your-french-substances"
```

> If you don't have git: `winget install git`

---

## Step 3 — Run the Setup Script

```powershell
cd "$HOME\.claude\skills\paint-me-like-your-french-substances"
.\setup.ps1
```

The script will:
- Check Python version
- Install `ffmpeg` via winget
- Install `yt-dlp`, `openai-whisper` via pip
- Install PyTorch with CUDA support (if NVIDIA GPU detected)

> **Note:** The CUDA torch download is ~2.8 GB. It may take 10–30 minutes depending on your connection.
> This script does **not** touch the optional Substance Painter MCP connection — see below for that, separately.

---

## Step 4 — Verify

```powershell
ffmpeg -version
python -c "import whisper, yt_dlp; print('all OK')"
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

Expected output:
```
ffmpeg version 8.x ...
all OK
CUDA: True    ← only if NVIDIA GPU present
```

---

## Step 5 — Test Ingest

Run a quick test without downloading the full video:
```powershell
cd "$HOME\.claude\skills\paint-me-like-your-french-substances"
python ingest.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" --skip-video
```

Step 1 alone (`ingest.py`, with or without `--skip-video`) never downloads video anymore — it only collects transcript + metadata, so this test runs in ~2 minutes either way. `--skip-video` instead permanently marks the tutorial `frame_status: skipped` (use it for text-only ingests where frame capture will never apply); without it, frames stay `pending-selection` until you run `select_frames.py`.

---

## Substance Painter MCP Connection (optional)

This is a **separate, manual, opt-in setup** — not part of `setup.ps1`, and not required for consulting or ingesting. It connects Claude directly to a *running Substance Painter session* so it can inspect/edit the layer stack, bake, and export live. Requires Substance 3D Painter actually installed.

Unlike Nuke (which needs a third-party addon dropped into its plugin folder), Painter already ships a built-in remote-scripting HTTP endpoint (`--enable-remote-scripting` launch flag, `localhost:60041`) — every option below just wraps that endpoint, no Painter-side plugin install needed.

Three documented options — full detail and repo links in `SKILL.md` → "Live Substance Painter Connection":

- **`elliezu/SubstancePainterMCP`** (recommended default — free, MIT, 79 tools, live-validated against Painter 12.1.1).
- **`diffdaff/substance-painter-mcp`** (simpler, free, MIT, 10 tools — good minimal alternative).
- **"MCP Pro for Painter"** (paid, $15 one-time, 179 tools — widest coverage, not open source, third-party commercial product).

General shape of the setup (exact steps live in the chosen repo/vendor's own docs — verify against them, since these are independently-maintained projects, not part of this skill):
1. Confirm Substance 3D Painter is installed.
2. Clone/download (or purchase, for Option C) the chosen MCP project.
3. Install its Python-side dependencies (`mcp` for elliezu's, `fastmcp` for diffdaff's).
4. Launch Painter with `--enable-remote-scripting`.
5. Point Claude Desktop/Claude Code's MCP config at the chosen server.
6. Test with a trivial request ("list the Texture Sets in my open project") before relying on it for real work.

## YouTube Bot Detection (cookies.txt)

As of 2026-08, `ingest.py` automatically passes `--extractor-args youtube:player_client=android` on every call that doesn't have a `cookies.txt` present, since YouTube's default `web_safari` client started throwing HTTP 429 + `Sign in to confirm you're not a bot` on many (not all) videos. This needs no setup — it's built into `_ytdlp_cmd()` in `ingest.py`. The android client only exposes a single combined mp4 (no audio-only stream); `download_audio()` handles that fine since it re-encodes to mp3 either way.

If a video *still* fails under the android client (rare — seen mainly on age-restricted or region-locked videos), fall back to cookies. Chrome 127+ broke yt-dlp's automatic cookie extraction (`--cookies-from-browser` fails with DPAPI error), so this has to be manual:

1. Install the **"Get cookies.txt LOCALLY"** extension in Chrome/Edge/Firefox
2. Go to **youtube.com** while logged in to your Google account
3. Click the extension icon → **Export** → save as **`cookies.txt`**
4. Place `cookies.txt` in `~/.claude/skills/paint-me-like-your-french-substances/` (same folder as `ingest.py`)
5. `ingest.py` detects it automatically and switches to cookie auth (dropping the android-client arg) — no other changes needed

> `cookies.txt` is in `.gitignore` and will never be committed to GitHub.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`ffmpeg: command not found` after install**
Open a new PowerShell window — PATH updates don't apply to the current session.

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'whisper'`**
```powershell
pip install openai-whisper
```

**`CUDA: False` when you have an NVIDIA GPU**
```powershell
pip install torch --force-reinstall --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

**Git push fails (authentication)**
```powershell
git config --global credential.helper manager
```
Then re-run the push — Windows Credential Manager will prompt for GitHub login.

**Whisper model download on first run**
The first time Whisper runs it downloads the model (~150 MB for `base`, ~461 MB for `small` — the default on CUDA machines). ingest.py prints a single "downloading weights (one-time)" notice instead of a progress bar. This is normal — subsequent runs use the cached model.

**Substance Painter not installed — skill still works**
This skill operates in consultant mode by default (no direct app connection required). You don't need Painter installed to ask questions, get Python code, or ingest tutorials. You only need Painter installed for the optional Mode 4 live connection, or to actually run generated Python.

**Substance Painter MCP connection not responding**
Confirm Painter was actually launched with `--enable-remote-scripting`, confirm the local MCP server process is running, and confirm port 60041 isn't blocked by a firewall. This connection is entirely separate from this skill's own scripts — if it's broken, `SKILL.md` Mode 1/2 (consult / write code) still work normally.

## Ingest Pipeline Reference

The pipeline is two scripts, run in sequence — frame capture is a deliberate,
content-aware step done by Claude Code, not something either script guesses at:

```
Step 1 — collect transcript only, no video/frames:
python ingest.py <url>
python ingest.py <url> --skip-video            article/text-only ingest, no frames ever
python ingest.py <url> --whisper-model medium  best accuracy, much slower
# Default model is auto-selected: "small" when a CUDA GPU is available, else "base".
# Pass --whisper-model explicitly to override either way.
python ingest.py <url> --force                 re-collect even if extraction_status: complete (overwrites Structured Notes)

Step 2 — after reading the timestamped transcript, capture the chosen moments:
python select_frames.py <slug> <ts1> <ts2> ...   seconds or mm:ss, e.g. 10 60 4:20 8:05
python select_frames.py <slug> ... --force       re-capture even if frame_status: complete
```

`ingest.py` refuses to overwrite a tutorial `.md` whose frontmatter already has `extraction_status: complete`, to protect hand-written Structured Notes from being wiped by an accidental re-ingest. Pass `--force` only when you intend to discard the existing extraction and will re-run the extraction pass afterward. `select_frames.py` has the same guard on `frame_status: complete`.

Pipeline stages:
1. yt-dlp metadata + chapter list
2. Whisper transcription (or yt-dlp captions fallback), per-sentence timestamps preserved even inside chapters
3. Transcript segmented by chapter
4. Write `tutorials/<slug>.md` (`frame_status: pending-selection`) + update `INDEX.md` + git push — **no video download, no frames yet**
5. Claude Code reads the timestamped transcript and picks 4-8 content-anchored moments (not blind percentages)
6. `select_frames.py <slug> <timestamps>` downloads the low-quality video, extracts exactly those frames to `tutorials/frames/<slug>/`, sets `frame_status: complete` — not committed yet
7. Claude Code vision-reads each captured frame (Layers panel, viewport, Baking/Export dialogs, Python Console) and writes the Structured Notes (core technique, steps, layers/tools/settings, tags)
8. Auto cross-linking with existing tutorials (2+ shared tags)
9. Update `INDEX.md`, commit `.md` + `INDEX.md` together, git push

## Frame capture height (`INGEST_FRAME_HEIGHT`)

Frames are captured at **1080p** in this skill (dense DCC UI — Substance parameter and layer stacks), set by
`DEFAULT_FRAME_HEIGHT` at the top of `ingest.py`. The value is per-skill on
purpose: `download_video_low()` itself is drift-gated across all five skills, so
its source stays identical while only the constant changes.

Raise or lower it for a single run without editing anything:

```
# PowerShell
$env:INGEST_FRAME_HEIGHT = "1080"; python ingest.py <url>
# bash
INGEST_FRAME_HEIGHT=1080 python ingest.py <url>
```

Why it matters: frames are how a claim gets checked against what was actually on
screen, and text that cannot be read cannot settle anything. Frames below **480p**
count as blind-era and `reground_frames.py` treats them as needing re-capture.
Raise this when a tutorial is a UI-heavy screencast and lower it only if disk or
bandwidth genuinely bites — the cap exists for download cost, not quality.

> This variable existed for weeks before being documented here, and so defaulted
> to 720p everywhere by accident. Per the Setup Sync Rule at the top of this
> file, a new environment variable must be added here in the same change.

## Note: captured frames are local-only

`tutorials/frames/` is gitignored — frame images never sync to GitHub. On a fresh
clone, `frame_status: complete` in a tutorial's frontmatter refers to frames that
existed on the machine that ingested it; the durable knowledge is the extracted
Structured Notes, not the images. If you need the stills again on this machine,
re-capture them with:

```
python select_frames.py <slug> <ts1> <ts2> ... --force
```

(timestamps are listed in the tutorial file's "Captured Frames" section).

## Ingest environment variables

Three knobs, all optional, all read at ingest time. Defaults are what every
batch run has used — set them only for a specific reason.

| variable | default | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `INGEST_FRAME_HEIGHT` | per-skill (see above) | max height for the frame-capture download |
| `INGEST_PROMPT_PRIMING` | `1` (on) | extend Whisper's `initial_prompt` with this video's own title, chapter titles and technical description terms |
| `INGEST_CAPTION_CROSSCHECK` | `1` (on) | fetch YouTube's auto-captions as a second, independent ASR witness and report Whisper spans it does not support |

```
# PowerShell
$env:INGEST_PROMPT_PRIMING = "0"; python ingest.py <url>
# bash
INGEST_CAPTION_CROSSCHECK=0 python ingest.py <url>
```

**`INGEST_PROMPT_PRIMING`** — a tutorial description usually names the exact
nodes being demonstrated, and `--dump-json` already fetched it before any audio
is decoded. Priming makes Whisper far likelier to emit `Cull Volume` than
`call volume`, attacking the mishear class at the source instead of detecting it
afterwards. Candidates are ranked chapter titles → video title → technical
tokens from the description, capped at Whisper's ~224-token prompt window.

> ⚠️ Non-Latin-script metadata is **dropped, never transliterated**. A
> wrong-language `initial_prompt` is the single most expensive bug in this
> pipeline's history — an English hint driving a Russian decode bled Spanish,
> Hangul and Chinese into five lessons. A Japanese title appended to an English
> prompt is that same mistake through a different door.

**`INGEST_CAPTION_CROSSCHECK`** — Whisper fabricates over silence; Google's ASR
generally emits nothing there. So a Whisper segment with no caption counterpart
in its window is a fabrication *candidate*, reported in the Ingest Safeguard
Report. Turn it off to skip one extra yt-dlp call per ingest.

> ⚠️ It reports, it never overrules. Auto-captions carry their own errors, so
> disagreement means "listen to this span", not "Whisper is wrong". An empty
> result can also mean the video simply has no caption track — **no witness
> available is not the same as no problems found**, and the run prints which of
> the two it got.
